# Chapter 3: Process Management and Communication

This chapter explores various concepts and Python implementations related to process management, interprocess communication (IPC), and process synchronization. It covers examples that demonstrate how processes communicate using pipes, queues, and barriers, as well as handling processes in the background, killing processes, and managing process pools.

## 1. **`communicating_with_pipe.py`**  
- Demonstrates interprocess communication using pipes to send data between processes.

## 2. **`communicating_with_queue.py`**  
- Demonstrates interprocess communication using queues to exchange data between processes.

## 3. **`derom.py`**  
- Implements a simple program related to process communication or management.

## 4. **`killing_processes.py`**  
- Demonstrates how to terminate running processes using Python.

## 5. **`myFunc.py`**  
- Defines a function or process-related code to be executed by processes.

## 6. **`naming_processes.py`**  
- Demonstrates the naming of processes and how to retrieve process names.

## 7. **`process_in_subclass.py`**  
- Shows how to subclass the Process class to create custom process implementations.

## 8. **`process_pool.py`**  
- Implements a process pool for concurrent execution of tasks using the Pool class.

## 9. **`processes_barrier.py`**  
- Demonstrates how to use barriers to synchronize processes and ensure they proceed together.

## 10. **`run_background_processes.py`**  
- Demonstrates how to run processes in the background.

## 11. **`run_background_processes_no_daemons.py`**  
- Shows how to run background processes that are not daemonized, meaning they do not exit when the main program ends.

## 12. **`spawning_processes.py`**  
- Demonstrates how to spawn new processes and manage their execution.

## 13. **`spawning_processes_namespace.py`**  
- Demonstrates how to use multiprocessing with a namespace to share data between processes.
