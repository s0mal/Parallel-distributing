# Asynchronous Programming in Python

This repository contains multiple examples of asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. The examples showcase how to manage event loops, run multiple coroutines, use `asyncio.Future` for coordination between tasks, and simulate a finite state machine. These examples help in understanding the concept of asynchronous programming and its application in real-world problems.

## Examples

### Example 1: Managing Event Loop
In this example, we demonstrate how to create an event loop that schedules tasks (`task_A`, `task_B`, and `task_C`) to run at specified times. The tasks execute one after the other in a non-blocking manner. 

**How it works:**
- `task_A`, `task_B`, and `task_C` are defined as functions that simulate some delay using `time.sleep()`.
- The event loop calls these tasks at regular intervals and stops when the end time is reached.

### Example 2: Running Multiple Coroutines
This example shows how to run multiple coroutines concurrently using `asyncio.create_task` and `asyncio.gather`.

**How it works:**
- Three coroutines (`factorial`, `fibonacci`, `binomial_coefficient`) are defined to perform their respective computations.
- These coroutines run concurrently, and `asyncio.gather` is used to execute them simultaneously.

### Example 3: Using asyncio.Future for Two Coroutines
This example demonstrates the use of `asyncio.Future` to coordinate two coroutines and retrieve their results once both tasks are completed.

**How it works:**
- Two coroutines (`first_coroutine` and `second_coroutine`) are defined.
- A `Future` object is used to store the result of each coroutine.
- The `add_done_callback` method is used to handle the result once the coroutines finish execution.

### Example 4: Finite State Machine Simulation
In this example, we simulate a finite state machine using `asyncio`. The system transitions between different states based on input values and performs actions based on the current state.

**How it works:**
- The state machine consists of several states (`start_state`, `state_1`, `state_2`, `state_3`).
- The system moves between states based on a random input value (either 0 or 1) and follows predefined transitions.
- The simulation ends when the system reaches the "End State."

## Requirements

To run the scripts in this chapter, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. The `asyncio` module is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installations are needed. However, for certain examples or any extensions you plan to implement (like parallel processing or MPI-based tasks), you may need additional libraries.

### Required Libraries:
- `asyncio`: For asynchronous programming (part of the Python standard library).
- (Optional for other implementations): `mpi4py` (if you plan to extend this with message-passing or parallelization).

### Installation Instructions:
If you plan to use MPI-based communication or implement parallel processing, you can install the required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install mpi4py
